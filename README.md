# Music History 7

## Setup

### Create a new branch

`git checkout -b version7`

### Update your .gitignore file for SASS

Add the following line to .gitignore

```
.sass-cache
```

## Requirements

## Using SASS

All your current CSS should be converted into SASS, and you must use SASS from this point forward.

## Using Automation

As you are working, ensure that your Gulp/Grunt task is running at all times so that your JavaScript code is automatically checked as you're writing it, and your SASS is compiled into CSS.

> **Note:** After you run your Gulp/Grunt task, if you add more JavaScript files, you need to restart grunt so that it recognizes the new file you added.

## Using Bootstrap

You need to have your application refactored to use the Bootstrap grid system for layout. From this point on, styling of your application is completely up to you, but you must be using Bootstrap grid system for layouts.
